Terraform Project

Project 1: Production-Grade Modular VPC and Networking using Terraform
Objective: Design and provision a production-grade modular VPC architecture along with networking components using Terraform, following real-world industry practices.
Key Highlights:
* Create modular Terraform code to provision:
    * VPC, Public and Private Subnets (across multiple AZs).
    * Internet Gateway, NAT Gateways, and Route Tables.
    * Security Groups and Network ACLs with least privilege access.
    * VPC Endpoints for secure access to AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.).
* Environments: Development, QA, and Production – each with isolated VPC and networking resources.
* Enforce security best practices:
    * No public access to private subnets.
    * Controlled egress/ingress rules for applications.
    * State file stored securely in S3 with DynamoDB for state locking.
* Terraform code structured in modules for reusability and scalability.
* This VPC setup will serve as the foundation for Project 2, with Terraform state outputs used as inputs.

Project 2: Secure Application Infrastructure Deployment on AWS using Terraform
Objective: Deploy and manage a secure, scalable application infrastructure on AWS using Terraform, leveraging the VPC created in Project 1.
Key Highlights:
* Provision core AWS services:
    * EC2 Instances (Auto Scaling enabled).
    * Elastic Load Balancer (ALB/NLB) for traffic distribution.
    * S3 Buckets with encryption, versioning, and lifecycle policies.
    * CloudFront for CDN and caching.
    * Route 53 for domain name management.
    * RDS (Multi-AZ, encrypted at rest & transit).
    * AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and retrieve credentials (DB password, API keys).
* Integrate Terraform remote state from Project 1 to reference VPC, subnets, and security groups.
* Implement high security standards:
    * IAM roles with least privilege.
    * EC2 instances without hardcoded secrets (all retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager).
    * HTTPS-enabled communication through SSL/TLS certificates.
    * Private subnets for RDS and application servers, public subnets only for load balancers.
* Support multi-environment deployment (Dev, QA, Production) with separate configurations and workspaces.
* Infrastructure designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and production-ready.



✅ Prerequisites
1. Knowledge & Setup
* Terraform installed (latest version, e.g., v1.6+) on your local machine.
* AWS CLI installed & configured (aws configure) with access key/secret.
* IAM user/role with necessary permissions (AdministratorAccess ideally, but least privilege is best practice).
* Basic Terraform workflow knowledge: init, plan, apply, destroy.
* Version Control (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) to maintain Terraform code.

2. AWS Setup
* AWS Account (Free Tier eligible if new).
* S3 bucket for Terraform state storage (with encryption enabled).
* DynamoDB table for Terraform state locking.
* Domain name in Route 53 (if you want to test DNS + CloudFront).

3. Tools for Security
* AWS Secrets Manager (for database and app credentials).
* SSL/TLS Certificates (can use AWS Certificate Manager – free for public certs).
* VPC Flow Logs / CloudTrail enabled for auditing (optional, but good practice).
