Project 1: Production-Grade Modular VPC and Networking using Terraform
Objective:Design and provision a production-grade modular VPC architecture along with networking components using Terraform, following real-world industry practices.
Key Highlights:
* Create modular Terraform code to provision:
    * VPC, Public and Private Subnets (across multiple AZs).
    * Internet Gateway, NAT Gateways, and Route Tables.
    * Security Groups and Network ACLs with least privilege access.
    * VPC Endpoints for secure access to AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.).
* Environments: Development, QA, and Production – each with isolated VPC and networking resources.
* Enforce security best practices:
    * No public access to private subnets.
    * Controlled egress/ingress rules for applications.
    * State file stored securely in S3 with DynamoDB for state locking.
* Terraform code structured in modules for reusability and scalability.
* This VPC setup will serve as the foundation for Project 2, with Terraform state outputs used as inputs.


## **Project Architecture**

### **Core Components**
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| VPC | Isolated and scalable virtual network. |
| Subnets | Public and private subnets across multiple AZs. |
| Internet Gateway | Allows public subnet Internet access. |
| NAT Gateway | Enables private subnets to access Internet securely. |
| Route Tables | Controls routing of network traffic. |
| Security Groups | Instance-level traffic control. |
| VPC Endpoints | Private connectivity to AWS services. |

### **Environments**
- **Dev**: `environments/dev/`
- **QA**: `environments/qa/`
- **Prod**: `environments/prod/`

Each environment uses its own Terraform workspace and variable files to ensure isolation and flexibility.

2. Validate Configuration
terraform validate

3. Plan Deployment
terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev/variables.tf

4. Apply Deployment
terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev/variables.tf

5. Destroy Infrastructure
terraform destroy -var-file=environments/dev/variables.tf


Replace dev with qa or prod for deploying respective environments.


Best Practices Implemented

Modular Terraform Code: Reusable modules for VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, and VPC endpoints.

Environment Separation: Independent dev/qa/prod deployments.

Security-First Design: Private subnets, least-privilege security groups, and VPC endpoints.

High Availability: Multi-AZ deployment for redundancy.

Scalability: Easily extendable to add more subnets or endpoints.

Conclusion

Project 1 establishes a robust, modular, and secure AWS networking infrastructure, providing a reliable foundation for application deployments and subsequent projects. Following best practices ensures maintainability, scalability, and security.
